# Single-cycle-processor-simulator
A single-cycle, functional processor simulator according to the reduced MIPSR3000 ISA.

Project Objective
	· Implement a single-cycle, functional processor simulator according to the reduced MIPSR3000 ISA.
	· Design your own test case to test the functionality of your simulator.

Test Script & Test Case:
	· Test cases are in 'student_valid_testcase' written by classmates.
	· New test cases could be generated by my another project 'mips-assembler' with assembly languages:
		https://github.com/zelzhang/mips-assembler
	· Run 'test_script.py' to run all test cases in 'student_valid_testcase'
