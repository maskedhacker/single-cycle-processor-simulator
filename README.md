# Single-cycle-processor-simulator
A single-cycle, functional processor simulator according to the reduced MIPSR3000 ISA.

Project Objective
  
a) Implement a single-cycle, functional processor simulator according to the reduced MIPSR3000 ISA.  

b) Design your own test case to test the functionality of your simulator.



Test Script & Test Case:

a) Test cases are in 'student_valid_testcase' written by classmates. 

b) New test cases could be generated by my another project 'mips-assembler' with assembly languages:  https://github.com/zelzhang/mips-assembler

c) Run 'test_script.py' to run all test cases in 'student_valid_testcase'
